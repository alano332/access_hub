## Accessible terminal

For users who need to manage remote servers or network devices, Access Hub includes an Accessible SSH Terminal. What makes it different is that there are some users who don't like the default style of windows terminal, Which sometimes is not as good as a normal textbox, This is the main reason behind this tool.

Session Management: Save and manage your SSH connection details for frequent access, securely storing session information with encryption.

File Manager Integration: Seamlessly transition to a file manager view for your SSH session, allowing for graphical file browsing and transfer on the remote server.

## Speech recognition

Access Hub includes a basic speech recognition using "Google", Allowing you to record a phrase and automatically type it anywhere. The reason behind this feature is that windows speech recognition by default is not good. Though access Hub has a basic speech recognition that only supports one service for now: there are plans to develop this in the future.

The shortcut for start recording is control + shift + h. Press once to record, Again to type the result.

Please note that it automatically detects and uses your keyboard language, There is no way of changing the language for now without changing the keyboard language, Though this will be added in the future.
