# Introduction

Access Hub is a multifunctional app designed with accessibility in mind that aims to include the most useful tools in one place, Without having to install lots of apps for your daily tasks. This app bundles a collection of powerful tools in one place, While focusing on each function within the app itself to be as better as possible.

Please note the following:

The app may not be ready for public use, It is for beta testing for now. Though the app is mostly very stable enough in most tasks: You might find bugs, Because this is a beta version, and since this is the first version.

Some features are not yet well-designed due to some reasons.

There are, of course, some undiscovered bugs I might not know about them. Please help by testing the app and leave your feedback by contacting me, Find contact info section below.

**Configuration Note:**

Many aspects of the Network Player, such as default download settings (type, quality, format), rewind/forward intervals, and what happens after a video finishes playing, can be customized in the application's main settings window, under the "YouTube" category.

## Accessible terminal

For users who need to manage remote servers or network devices, Access Hub includes an Accessible SSH Terminal. What makes it different is that there are some users who don't like the default style of windows terminal, Which sometimes is not as good as a normal textbox, This is the main reason behind this tool.

Session Management: Save and manage your SSH connection details for frequent access, securely storing session information with encryption.

File Manager Integration: Seamlessly transition to a file manager view for your SSH session, allowing for graphical file browsing and transfer on the remote server.

## Speech recognition

Access Hub includes a basic speech recognition using "Google", Allowing you to record a phrase and automatically type it anywhere. The reason behind this feature is that windows speech recognition by default is not good. Though access Hub has a basic speech recognition that only supports one service for now: there are plans to develop this in the future.

The shortcut for start recording is control + shift + h. Press once to record, Again to type the result.

Please note that it automatically detects and uses your keyboard language, There is no way of changing the language for now without changing the keyboard language, Though this will be added in the future.

## Online Text-to-Speech (TTS)

The Online TTS tool allows you to convert text into speech using online services.

**Main Features:**
*   **Input Text:** Enter text directly into the text area.
*   **Speech Generation:**
    *   **Manual Mode:**
        *   Select the desired language and specific voice from the available options (powered by Microsoft Speech Services).
        *   Adjust speech parameters:
            *   **Rate:** Controls the speed of the speech (-100 to 100).
            *   **Pitch:** Adjusts the pitch of the voice (-100 to 100).
            *   **Volume:** Sets the volume of the generated audio (1 to 100).
    *   **Auto-detect Language Mode:**
        *   When enabled, the tool attempts to automatically detect the language of the input text.
        *   It will try to use a suitable voice from Microsoft Speech Services if available for the detected language.
        *   If a Microsoft voice isn't found for the detected language, it will use Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) as a fallback.
*   **Output:** Generates an MP3 audio file of the spoken text. You will be prompted to choose a location to save the file.

**Batch Processing:**
*   The tool also includes a batch processing feature to convert multiple text inputs to speech in one go.
*   **Input Sources for Batch:**
    *   **Add Text:** Manually add individual text snippets to the batch list.
    *   **Select Files:** Add multiple text files; the content of each file will be processed.
*   **Output for Batch:**
    *   You'll be asked to select an output directory for all generated MP3 files.
    *   Files generated from input text files will retain the original filename (e.g., `document.txt` becomes `document.mp3`).
    *   Files generated from manually added text will be named sequentially (e.g., `output_1.mp3`, `output_2.mp3`).
*   The batch process uses the language, voice (if in manual mode), and speech parameter settings currently active in the main Online TTS window.

## Application Updater

Access Hub includes an automatic update checker to help you stay current with the latest features and fixes.

**How it Works:**
*   On startup, the application can check a designated server for a new version.
*   If a newer version is found, you will be notified and asked if you wish to download and install the update.
*   If you choose to update, the new version will be downloaded. A progress dialog will show the download status (file name, size, percentage complete, and a cancel option).
*   Once the download is complete, the application will attempt to launch the installer for the new version. You may need to grant administrative privileges for the installer to run.
*   The main application will typically close after launching the installer.

**Notes:**
*   An active internet connection is required for the update check and download.
*   The update process involves downloading an installer file, which then handles the actual update of the application files.

## Application Settings

Access Hub provides a settings dialog where you can customize various aspects of the application's behavior and the functionality of its tools. These settings are saved in a configuration file (`settings.ini`) located in your user-specific application data directory.

You can typically access the settings through a "Settings" or "Preferences" option in the main application menu (e.g., under "File" or "Edit").

The settings are organized into categories. Here's an overview of what you can configure:

**General Settings:**
*   **Minimize to tray on close:** Choose whether closing the main window minimizes the application to the system tray or exits it.
*   **Hide main window when opening tools:** Decide if the main Access Hub window should automatically hide when you launch one of its tools.
*   **Check for updates at startup:** Enable or disable automatic checking for new versions of Access Hub when it starts.

**Tool-Specific Settings:**
Many individual tools also have their own settings that can be adjusted here. For example:
*   **Network Player (YouTube):**
    *   Configure default playback behaviors like fast forward/rewind intervals and default volume.
    *   Set your preferred default video playback quality.
    *   Define what happens after a video finishes (e.g., close player, replay).
    *   Choose the update channel for `yt-dlp` (the underlying YouTube downloader).
    *   Set default download preferences:
        *   Default type (Video or Audio).
        *   Default video quality for downloads.
        *   Default audio format (e.g., MP3, WAV) and quality for audio downloads.
        *   Specify a default directory for your downloads.
*   **ElevenLabs:**
    *   Securely store your ElevenLabs API key, which is required to use the ElevenLabs integration.

Other tools may also have configurable options available in their respective settings sections. Exploring the Settings dialog is recommended to tailor Access Hub to your preferences.
